\begin{abstract}
We put forth a \emph{keyless wallet}, a cryptocurrency wallet
in which money can be spent using a password alone, and no private
keys are required.
It requires a smart contract blockchain.
We propose two schemes. In the first, the user sets a short wallet password
and can spend their money at a prespecified maturity date using the
password alone.
In the second scheme, the user uses an OTP authenticator seed to initially
generate a long series of time-based OTP passwords for the foreseeable
future.  These are organized in a Merkle tree whose root is stored in a
smart contract.
The user can spend funds at any time by simply visually providing
the current OTP password from an airgapped device.
These OTPs can be relatively short:
Just $6$ alphanumeric characters suffice.
Our OTP scheme can work in proof-of-stake as well as
static and variable difficulty proof-of-work blockchains.
The low-entropy in the passwords and OTPs in our scheme is protected
from brute force attempts by requiring that an adversary accompany
any brute force attempt by a transaction on the chain. This quickly
incurs enormous gas costs for the adversary. Thus, we develop the first decentralized
\emph{rate limiting} scheme.
We use
\emph{Witness Encryption} (WE) to construct a timelock encryption scheme
in which passwords are encrypted from past into future blocks
by leveraging the \textsc{NP}-language expressing
proof-of-work or proof-of-stake performed as the witness. Witness Encryption is
a currently impractical cryptographic primitive,
but our scheme may become practical
as these primitives are further developed.
