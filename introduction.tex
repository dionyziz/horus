\section{Introduction}

The management of cryptocurrency~\cite{bitcoin} wallet
private keys is a hassle.
Can we get rid of them and replace them with a simple short password or
a rotating $6$-digit one-time password (OTP)~\cite{rfc6238,rfc4226}? Users are more familiar with this
model, but this seems, at first sight, impossible to achieve:
The blockchain is public infrastructure, and anyone has access to the
public keys and smart contracts~\cite{buterin,wood} governing the conditions under which
one can spend. Any short password or OTP will be easily broken by an offline
brute force attack~\cite{brain-drain}.

Perhaps unexpectedly, it \emph{is} possible to build brute force resilient wallets
by leveraging the blockchain infrastructure itself.
We build the first \emph{keyless cryptocurrency wallet}.
It operates as follows.
Alice initially uses her mobile wallet to generate a high entropy OTP seed.
This seed is used to generate
a large amount of time-based OTPs (with, say, hourly resolution), which are encrypted
and collected into a Merkle tree. The wallet creates a smart contract containing the
Merkle tree root on the blockchain and outputs a wallet address to which money can
be deposited at any time. The internal nodes of the Merkle tree are posted on a public,
high availability location such as IPFS~\cite{ipfs} and can also be kept by Alice
in any untrusted device, if desired for availability. Alice then disconnects the mobile wallet and keeps it
completely air gapped and offline. At any time, Alice can use the offline device to generate
a time-based OTP. Without plugging in the offline device via USB or connecting it
to the Internet, Alice visually copies the short (perhaps $6$ alphanumeric characters long)
OTP that appears on the device's screen into her online computer. The wallet on
her online computer can then be used to input a target address and amount to be transferred.
This second construction allows the user
to spend money \emph{at any time}. As the OTPs are very short, this wallet is highly usable.
After the initial OTP seed generation, the seed is kept in an
air gapped device, ensuring any bugs in the hardware or software cannot be abused
to steal it.

Critical to the security of the construction is ensuring that no adversary can
brute force the short password or OTPs.
Towards that goal, we devise a new cryptographic mechanism to secure cryptocurrency
wallet passwords from offline brute forcing attempts. Any adversary who wishes
to brute force these passwords \emph{must} do so through the chain itself and
record the attempt in a transaction. As such, these attempts are governed by
the limitations of the chain: Each transaction costs gas to perform. This
gives rise to the first \emph{decentralized rate limiting} mechanism. Through
appropriate cryptoeconomic parametrization, we ensure that the adversary will,
in expectation, and with any desired probability, lose much more money than they
will win out of brute forcing attempts. The parametrization dictates the length
of the password based on current transaction gas costs and the capital to be
protected.

To achieve this property, we leverage the fact that the network is performing
proof-of-work~\cite{pow} (or proof-of-stake~\cite{ouroboros}) in a predictable rate in expectation~\cite{bitcoin-sok}. We use \emph{Witness Encryption}
(WE)~\cite{STOC:GGSW13} to encrypt
the password in such a way that it can only be decrypted using the \emph{future}
proof-of-work/stake that will be performed by the network. As such, the encryption
is a \emph{Timelock Encryption}~\cite{timelock} in which the miners function in tandem~\cite{timelock-bitcoin} to
decrypt the submitted password. This decryption is a by-product of
the proof-of-work/stake they are performing anyway. The miners do not need to know that the
passwords have been timelock encrypted. The security of timelock encryption
ensures that the passwords will not be decryptable prior to the chain progressing
a certain number of blocks. Our security argument stands upon five pillars:

\begin{enumerate}
      \item a secure \emph{extractable} Witness Encryption scheme,
      \item a secure underlying blockchain (with \emph{Common Prefix}),
      \item a \emph{preimage}/\emph{collision} resistant hash function;
      \item a secure \emph{pseudorandom} OTP scheme, and
      \item a rational adversary.
\end{enumerate}

Our constructions could, in principle, be deployed to any smart-contract--enabled
proof-of-work/stake chain such as Ethereum. In particular, we do not require any modifications
to the Ethereum consensus mechanism or smart contract virtual machine (EVM). The
best known instantiation of the Witness Encryption primitive, which the Timelock Encryption
instance makes use of, requires the use of \emph{multilinear maps}.
Multilinear maps are (approximately) constructible using ideal lattices.
Unfortunately, this construction currently remains impractical.
Until such constructions are built, our scheme is of theoretical interest.

\noindent
\textbf{Our contributions.}
The contributions of this paper are summarized as follows:

\begin{itemize}
  \item We introduce the first timelock-based \emph{OTP} wallet, with OTP length of
        just 6 alphanumeric characters. The funds can be spent any time just by
        providing the OTP password from an air gapped device.
  \item We put forth the first
        \emph{decentralized rate limiting} scheme. The scheme protects the user
        from brute force attacks by an adversary by requiring all attempts to
        be recorded on the chain.
\end{itemize}

Secondary contributions include the first instantiation of timelock encryption applied
to proof-of-stake blockchains and variable difficulty proof-of-work blockchains, explored
in the appendix. Lastly,
our security argument, in the appendix, uses a hybrid approach which combines a high-entropy
cryptographic parameter --- in which classical cryptographic security is ensured with overwhelming
probability --- with a low-entropy cryptoeconomic parameter whose role is to ensure the
attack is uneconomical for a rational adversary. This novel proof methodology may be of
independent interest in analyzing blockchain protocols, which often compose cryptography
and economics.

Our security assumptions pertain to pseudorandomness, hash security, and lattice-based cryptography.
Therefore our wallets are also quantum-resistant.
