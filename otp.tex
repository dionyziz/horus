\section{An OTP Wallet}

- can limit daily amount
- can be used as 2FA (OTP+key) or 1FA (without key, just OTP)
- MUST be time-based OTP, not counter OTP in this case

             ciphertexts $c_t$ are
             then organized into a Merkle Tree whose root is $r$.}

             becomes airgapped and the user submits the OTP visually to an online computer
             at time $t$.}
